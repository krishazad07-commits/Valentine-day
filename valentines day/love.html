      <p>I am grateful to have you in my life, and I never want you to leave me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, grow old with you, and have kids with you. I love you so much.</p>

      <p>I created this small little thing just to make my gorgeous—the most beautiful and the cutest girl in the whole world—feel special. I adore you every single day and can't live without you, even for a minute.</p>

      <p>I have spent the best moments of my life with you, and you have taught me so many things. Thank you for improving me and for always being patient with me. I know I can be hard sometimes, but believe me, there is no one on this planet who loves you more than I do.</p>

      <p>You are, and always will be, in my prayers. My day is never complete without talking to you or seeing you happy.</p>

      <p class="letter-signature">Happy Valentine's Day, my love. This is just the beginning—many more beautiful moments are yet to come. ❤️</p>
